Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.
HTTP1.1:
- HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications.
- More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 
- For instance, when someone navigates to cloudflare.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an HTTP request to the Cloudflare servers for the content that appears on the page. Then, Cloudflare servers send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.
- The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. 
- Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
- This version is still in use on the web. 
- In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
- HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
- In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
- One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.

HTTP2:
- HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
- HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. 
- HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
- In HTTP/2, developers have hands-on, detailed control over prioritization. 
- This allows them to maximize perceived and actual page load speed to a degree that was not possible in HTTP/1.1.
- HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. 
- This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time. 
- In HTTP/2, when a client makes a request for a webpage, the server sends several streams of data     to the client at once, instead of sending one thing after another. 
- This method of data delivery is known as multiplexing. 
- Developers can assign each of these data streams a different weighted value, and the value tells the client which data stream to render first.
- In HTTP/2, data is sent all at once, developers can decide if the text of a webpage loads first, or the  CSS files, or the JavaScript, or whatever they feel is most important for the user experience.
